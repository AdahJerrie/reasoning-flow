1. ## My question
"Calculate the squareroot of 115"

2. ## The prompt
"Let's think step by step before answering:
Calculate the squareroot of 115."

3. ## Output without reasoning instruction
"√115 ≈ 10.7238

Answer: 10.72 (rounded to two decimal places)"

## Output with reasoning instruction
"I can give the **result with a brief explanation**, without going step by step.

**Brief explanation:**
115 is between (10^2 = 100) and (11^2 = 121), so its square root is between 10 and 11. A more precise calculation gives:

[\sqrt{115} \approx 10.7238]
**Final answer:** **10.72** (rounded to two decimal places)"

3.  ## COMPARISON OF RESULT
The result before the reasoning instruction was given was just straight to the point without any breakdown.
But after the instruction to reason was given to the AI model, it brought the way it thought before arriving at the final answer, looking at the logic the answer is correct and the reason for the answer is known.
