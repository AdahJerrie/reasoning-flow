2. ## my created prompt 
"A teacher has 7 packs of 12 pencils and 2 packs of 54 pencils. The teacher shares these pencils out into 8 pencils pots. How many pencils will be in each pot?
Given the above problem. Restate the problem in clear terms, breaking it into smaller steps, solve each step before giving the final answer."

3. ## AI output without the reasoning prompt
"**Brief explanation:**
The teacher has (7 \times 12 = 84) pencils and (2 \times 54 = 108) pencils.
Altogether, that’s (84 + 108 = 192) pencils.
Sharing them equally into 8 pots gives (192 \div 8 = 24) pencils per pot.

**Final answer:** **Each pot will have 24 pencils.**"

## AI output with the reasoning prompt
### Restated problem (clear and broken down)

### Step-by-step solution

**Step 1: Find the number of pencils from the first type of pack**
(7 \times 12 = 84) pencils

**Step 2: Find the number of pencils from the second type of pack**
(2 \times 54 = 108) pencils

**Step 3: Find the total number of pencils**
(84 + 108 = 192) pencils

**Step 4: Share the pencils equally into 8 pots**
(192 \div 8 = 24)

### ✅ Final answer

**Each pencil pot will contain 24 pencils.**

## Review
I ran the prompt without the reason guide, the answer as always was very direct. No step by step explanation, so the output is kind of vague and direct. 
For the prompt ran with the reasoning guide, the output is very robust, very detailed. The step by step break down is very clear and understandable. Since I also know what I am expecting, it's outpu was accurate.
